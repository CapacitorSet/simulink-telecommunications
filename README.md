# Telecommunications demos in Simulink

This repo contains models of some telecommunications techniques. Specifically, it has solutions to the exercises from the course 03NVCNX - 
Teoria dei segnali e delle comunicazioni offered by Politecnico di Torino.

## Content

### Exercise 1: AM modulation

Missing.

### Exercise 2: 2-PAM

Comparing the performance of 2-PAM modulation using either:

 * a rectangular tx filter and a FIR low-pass rx filter, or
 * a raised-cosine tx and rx filter

on a simple channel with AWGN.

### Exercise 3: QPSK

Observing the Bit Error Rate for QPSK baseband modulation. Raised-cosine tx and rx filter, AWGN channel.

Contains the BER plot for a 2 dB SNR.

### Exercise 4: system parameters

Interfacing with Matlab to import and export variables. Specifically, plotting the BER against the channel SNR.
